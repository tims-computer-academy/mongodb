# Phase 4: Local Security for Daily Use

This phase teaches you how to **secure your local MongoDB server** for responsible, long-term use on your own system.

By default, MongoDB is open and unauthenticated â€” good for learning, but risky for real data. Weâ€™ll now configure basic protections:

ðŸ”’ Require login credentials (authentication)<br>
ðŸ”’ Assign specific user roles (read-only, admin, etc.)<br>
ðŸ”’ Block outside access with a firewall<br>
ðŸ”’ Make encrypted backups<br>
ðŸ”’ Understand how MongoDB logs user actions

---

## Step 1: Enable MongoDB Authentication

MongoDB starts with **no login required**. Letâ€™s fix that.

### A. Create a MongoDB Admin User

First, open the MongoDB shell **before** enabling authentication:

```bash
mongosh
```

Switch to the `admin` database (MongoDBâ€™s system-wide config DB):

```js
use admin
```

Create a new admin user:

```js
db.createUser({
  user: "localadminadmin",
  pwd: "strong_password_here",
  roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
})
```

This user can create other users and manage access across all databases.

If you want this (or another) user to have root/superuser rights, i.e. full admin access, you can provide this with:

```js
db.grantRolesToUser("localadmin", [
  { role: "root", db: "admin" }
])
```

You can now exit `mongosh`:

```js
exit
```

### B. Edit `mongod.conf` to Require Login

Find your MongoDB config file â€” usually here:

```
/etc/mongod.conf
```

Open it in a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
```

Scroll down (or add this section if missing):

```yaml
security:
  authorization: enabled
```

Save and close the file.

Restart MongoDB to apply the change:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

Now authentication is required for any operation.

---

## Step 2: Connect with Login Credentials

### In the MongoDB Shell

Open the MongoDB shell again:

```bash
mongosh
```

Now log in with your new admin user:

```js
use admin
db.auth("localadmin", "strong_password_here")
```

If successful, youâ€™re now authenticated.

To skip `db.auth(...)` every time, you can also connect like this:

```bash
mongosh -u localadmin -p --authenticationDatabase admin
```

(MongoDB will prompt you for the password.)

### In MongoDB Compass

Open MongoDB Compass.

On the left pane, click on the three dots next to your respective database. Select **Edit Connection** -> **Advanced Connection Options** -> **Authentication**. Choose **Username/Password** and enter:

* Username: your user name
* Password: your password
* Authentication: admin

Click on: **Save & Connect**.

From now on, when you open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database, the system will login with your credentials.

To strengthen security, you can go to **Edit** -> **Settings** and enable **Protect Connection String Secrets**. This will hide the credentials in connection strings from users.

---

## Step 3: Create Limited Users

You donâ€™t want to use the `admin` user for everyday work. Letâ€™s create a limited user for your database.

### Create a Read/Write User for Your Archive

In the shell, after logging in as admin, swith to the database where the new user shall be added to, e.g.: `use personal_archive`

Then create the new user with the following command:

```js
db.createUser({
  user: "archive_user", # Enter user name hier
  pwd: "another_strong_password", #Enter password here
  roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "personal_archive" } ] # Replace the name of your database
})
```

You can now log in as this user when working on your files and metadata.

---

## Step 4: Restrict Network Access (Firewall)

By default, MongoDB listens on **all interfaces** (e.g. `0.0.0.0`), but we want to limit access to **localhost only** â€” especially if your computer is ever on a public network.

### A. Limit Access to Localhost Only

Edit the config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
```

Find the `net:` section and make sure it says:

```yaml
net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
  port: 27017
```

This ensures that only local programs (on your machine) can connect.

Restart the server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

### B. Add a Firewall Rule (optional but good)

If you use `ufw`:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 27017
```

Then deny everything else:

```bash
sudo ufw deny 27017
```

Check your rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

This makes sure nobody else can connect to your MongoDB server from the outside.

---

## Step 5: Make Encrypted Backups

You should back up your database regularly â€” and encrypt the backups in case someone else gains access.

### A. Dump Your Database

```bash
mongodump --db personal_archive --out /home/yourname/mongodb_backups
```

This creates a folder of `.bson` and `.json` files â€” the full dump.

### B. Encrypt the Backup (GPG or OpenSSL)

#### Option 1: GPG

```bash
gpg -c /home/yourname/mongodb_backups/personal_archive.bson
```

This encrypts the file with a password.

#### Option 2: OpenSSL

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in backup.bson -out backup.bson.enc
```

Choose strong encryption and store passwords safely (e.g., password manager or offline).

---

## Step 6: Understand Logs and Auditing

MongoDB logs activity to a file â€” usually:

```
/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```

You can view it:

```bash
sudo less /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```

Youâ€™ll see events like:

* Connections opened
* Authentication attempts
* Commands run (e.g., queries, inserts)

If needed, you can enable deeper **audit logging**, but thatâ€™s more advanced and only used for strict monitoring.

## Summary: What You Learned in Phase 4

âœ… Require logins for MongoDB access<br>
âœ… Create admin and read/write users<br>
âœ… Limit access to localhost<br>
âœ… Use `ufw` or `iptables` to block outside traffic<br>
âœ… Make secure, encrypted backups<br>
âœ… Read logs to understand user actions

With these protections, your MongoDB database is now suitable for **private, daily use** â€” safe from unauthorized access, even on a shared network.
