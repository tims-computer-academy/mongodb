# Learning Path: MongoDB

**Objectives**

* Store structured and unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, images)
* Use MongoDB daily like in enterprise environments
* Stay fully open source (no paid services)
* Prioritize **information security**

**Environment**
* Linux

## Phase 0: Install & Secure MongoDB Locally

| Topic                   | Goal                                             |

| Configure default paths | Verify data (`/var/lib/mongodb`) and logs        |
| Lock down local access  | Bind MongoDB to localhost only                   |

## Phase 1: Store & Retrieve Files with GridFS

| What is GridFS? | Learn how MongoDB stores large files         |
| Store a PDF     | Upload a PDF file to MongoDB                 |
| Retrieve a PDF  | Download it back from the DB to disk         |
| Add metadata    | Attach tags, source info, descriptions, etc. |

## Phase 2: MongoDB CRUD & Querying Basics

| User roles            | Limit privileges (read-only, admin, etc.)   |
| Local firewall rules  | Block external access, only allow localhost |
| Encrypted backups     | Dump and encrypt data regularly             |
| Scheduled backups     | Automate daily encrypted dumps              |
| Logging & audit trail | Track who did what in the DB                |

## Phase 5: Remote Access & Self-Hosting

| TLS with self-signed certs | Encrypt traffic between client/server     |
| SSH or VPN tunneling       | Harden access from remote systems         |
| Fail2Ban & firewall tuning | Prevent brute-force & unauthorized access |
| Monitoring usage           | Check DB health, performance, backups     |
