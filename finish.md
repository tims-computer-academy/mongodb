You've completed the MongoDB learning path.

![MongoDB Capstone Completed](https://dummyimage.com/400x60/901090/ffffff\&text="MongoDB"+Completed)

But don’t stop here — the more you explore, the more potential you’ll uncover.

## Now, it’s time to go beyond

Once you’ve grasped the basics, these resources can guide you to the next level:

* [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
* [GridFS Overview](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/)
* [MongoDB BSON Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/)
* [mongosh Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/)
* [Database Design (Microsoft)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/database-design-basics-eb2159cf-1e30-401a-8084-bd4f9c9ca1f5)

And here some ideas, what else you could do with MongoDB:

* Remote collaboration: Set up multi-user access, role auditing
* Deployment to VPS/cloud: Host MongoDB on DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc.
* Full-stack integration: Connect with Python, Node.js, or front-end frameworks
* ...

**The real power of MongoDB unfolds as you explore more advanced use cases and start building your own projects.**
